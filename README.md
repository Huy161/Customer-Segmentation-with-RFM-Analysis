# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis
## Context
Online retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## Business Goal
I will be using the online retail trasnational dataset to build a RFM clustering and choose the best set of customers, so that the company can target its customers efficiently.

## Source of Dataset:
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/online-retail-customer-clustering"></a>
